Common **treatment protocols** for cancer patients typically involve a **multidisciplinary approach** tailored to the type and stage of cancer. These protocols commonly include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormone therapy.  Combinations of these modalities are often employed to maximize effectiveness. For example, patients may undergo surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation to eradicate remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. Additionally, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may be used in conjunction with traditional treatments to enhance their efficacy, particularly in advanced or metastatic cancers. The goal of combining these modalities is to achieve better outcomes by targeting cancer cells through multiple mechanisms while minimizing side effects.

**Neo-adjuvant** protocols are changing cancer care by allowing for treatment before primary therapy, potentially reducing tumor size and increasing the success of subsequent interventions. **Adjuvant therapy** complements primary treatments by targeting any remaining cancer cells, reducing the risk of recurrence, and improving long-term outcomes. Together, these protocols enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatment strategies and contribute to improved patient survival and quality of life.
